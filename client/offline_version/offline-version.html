<!-- 
This is an old prototype of the client that visualizes prerecorded
movements (stored as sequence of poses in a file) instead of 
connecting to the server.

Since the original version of this code is from the beginning of 
the development phase, it lacked many improvements, such as the improved
retargeting and the scaling functionality. The main reason this old offline
version is part of the repository is because it is a useful tool when 
porting the system from Kinect to another tracking device (so you can
prerecord some poses and work on the skeleton, retargeting, etc. without 
anyone moving in front of the tracking device all the time).

The code was updated to include the new model and part of the retargeting.
But due to missing scale information, it won't look that good. But its 
just for development, anyways.
